I have high expectations for the CSMC 100 web development course, aiming to gain a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals. I also look forward to learning about responsive web design and mobile optimization, recognizing their importance in today's digital landscape. Advanced topics like web frameworks and content management systems are on my radar, as I believe they can streamline development processes. Lastly, hands-on projects and real-world applications are anticipated to help me apply what I've learned practically.
